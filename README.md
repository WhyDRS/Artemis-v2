# Hello Artemis!

Artemis is a FOSS **protector**, safeguarding your server from VPNs, Tor, malicious IPs, and alt accounts. She's a reliable, no-nonsense verification bot for your community. This is the GitHub mirror of the v2 rewrite originally hosted on GitLab for [High Seas](https://highseas.hackclub.com).
